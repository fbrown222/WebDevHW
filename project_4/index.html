    <p>So, what is the importance of RWD (Responsive Web Design)?
      RWD is really important if you want your website to have a nice
      flow across all platforms. Your website will be accessed almost everywhere
      from many different devices. You can't expect every user to have an iPhone,
      or an iMac. Screen sizes can differ, so you want your site to be responsive
      to whomever is viewing it from almost any device.
    </br></br>

      RWD can make it easy for users to read paragraphs, or click links if using
      a mobile device. Not all fingers are created the same, so making appropriate
      clicking buttons big enough and easy enough to use is very important. If your
      site is not easy to use across all sizes, you're likely to loose viewers and
      users. So, try to be all inclusive!</p>
