    <p align="center" class="content"> <span class="review">So you're either an fan of Frankenstein,
      or noob who pretends to like Frankenstein because you like
      Halloween.</br> Either way, welcome fellow nerds. Step into the world
    of great literature and good story telling. Don't believe me? </br>Here
  are some reviews of one of the greatest novels ever written. </p>

</br>
<p align="center" class="content"> <span class="review">"If you're reading this review, you only have one question. You're not looking for a book review, you already know </br>
  it's a classic. You already know this is the most original, and one of the best, and best-written horror stories in literature. You may or may not like the story,</br>
   but that's a matter of personal taste. A lot of people don't like Shakespeare, but no one questions whether he was a good writer or not. If you don't like the </br>
   writing style, it's because you aren't familiar with the English of this period. Nearly eighty years before Stoker's "Dracula" ( an idea stolen from Polidori's </br>
   "The Vampyre", which was an idea stolen from LeFanu's "Carmilla"), this most-original horror masterpiece was born. So, your only question is, "Is this really the </br>
   uncensored 1818 version? Because I've only seen one other verified version, and it's over twenty dollars in paperback. All the others claiming to be the 1818 version </br>
   have been disproved." YES, as far as I can tell, it is. The only preface is Shelley's own original. There is no introduction, no commentary or editorial credits </br>
    whatsoever. There are no illustrations, and the spelling and language have not been edited. Have a good thesaurus handy. So, here it is, the author's original </br>
    script, no frills, for a bargain price. Which is exactly what I was looking for." -mka33 (Amazon Reviewer)
