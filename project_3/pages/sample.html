    <h1 class="main-heading">Frankenstein</h1>
    <p class="content"> “I do know that for the sympathy of one living being,
      I would make peace with all. I have love in me the likes of which you
      can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe.
      If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other.”
― Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Frankenstein </p>
