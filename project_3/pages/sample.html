          So the most common mistake people make about Frankenstein</br>
          is that Frankenstein is the name of the "creature".</br>
          Although this is not entirely false (the scientist, Victor is</br>
          Von Frankenstein is quite cruel), the creature actually </br>
          is never given a name in the novel. Over time Hollywood added</br>
          the bolts and green skin. Although Shelley describes the creature</br>
          to be absolutely terrifying, he is actually more yellow, with translucent</br>
          skin. The creature, being like any person born into this world is quite </br>
          innocent at first. He has the utmost potential to be good, but his</br>
          creator neglects what he deserves, and thus our poor creature does bad things.</br>
          Below is an exerpt from the novel in this very moment of turning:</p>

      <div class="text-block">
       “I do know that for the sympathy of one living being,</br>
      I would make peace with all. I have love in me the likes of </br>
      which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which </br>
       you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge </br>
        the other.”</br>
― The Creature in Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's, Frankenstein </p>
