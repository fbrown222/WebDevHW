    <p class="content" align="center"> “I do know that for the sympathy of one living being,</br>
      I would make peace with all. I have love in me the likes of </br>
      which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which </br>
       you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge </br>
        the other.”</br>
― Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Frankenstein </p>
