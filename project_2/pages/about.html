         <b>So, why onigiri? </b></br>
         This project was created to share
         the magic that is onigiri. Onigiri is, again, a simple japanese snack. </br>
         Its quite filling and easy to be delicious.
         Just like pizzas (<em><b>almost</b></em> everyone likes pizza).</br>
         The best part is that it can be a fairly health snack alternative as well. Unlike pb&amp;j's </br>
         the Japanese "sandwich" is less sugary, and less processed. You can even find</br>
         brown rice onigiri that has more fiber. Not only is it simple and healthier,</br>
         its also cheap like a pb&amp;j. </p>

         <p id="me-and-japan" align="center">
          <b> So, how did I find onigiri?</b></br>
          Personally, I have known about onigiri for years now. <b>BUT</b> I never tried it, until</br>
          I went to Japan recently.I usually am open to trying to cook foreign foods I have never</br>
           tried before; such as: <dfn>deokbokki</dfn> (a Korean spicy rice cake snack). Is this </br>
           a wise thing to do? I'm not sure. Because I'm making something I have never tried before, </br>
           I can't compare it to the real thing. So, I can't taste how authentic it is. On the other </br>
           hand, I've enjoyed what I've made so far, so it's possible I did it correctly, or I made </br>
           it taste even BETTER than the original (the latter option is less likely though).</p>

           <p id="magic-of-onigiri" align="center">
             <b>So, why is onigiri so magical?</b></br>
             The magic of onigiri can only really be described by actually tasting it. Is it the
             most delicious thing I have ever tasted on the planet? Not really. <b>BUT</b> thats
             what I love about it. Don't get me wrong, I still find it delicious. Where the
             beauty of onigiri comes from is it's simplicity. The most delicious foods are
             often hard to come by, or hard to make, or take too long to make. Onigiri is
             easy to make! You can make it at home (in the USA you don't have a choice,
             unless you live nearby a "Little Tokyo")! It's just all around nice!</p>
